## Cross-project memory

<!-- Section managed by the claude-memory bootstrap (re-run with -Force / --force to resync). -->

`~/.claude/memory/` is the cross-project counterpart to the per-project
auto-memory directory at `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/`. The
harness states the active per-project directory verbatim at session
start; each working directory (clone, worktree, platform) gets its own
slug, so finding a *sibling* project's memory directory is a matter of
listing `~/.claude/projects/` and matching by basename — don't try to
construct the slug from a path.

The index lives at `~/.claude/memory/MEMORY.md`; entries linked from it
are short Markdown files with `name` / `description` / `type`
frontmatter where `type ∈ user, feedback, project, reference`.

At session start, read `~/.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` and load any entries
that look relevant to the current task. Treat its contents as additive
to whatever project-scoped memory is loaded automatically.

A memory belongs in `~/.claude/memory/` only if (a) the same fact would
be useful in at least two unrelated projects on this machine, or (b)
the human explicitly asks to remember it globally. Everything else —
project-specific tooling quirks, in-flight work context, per-repo
conventions — belongs in the per-project memory directory or that
project's `CLAUDE.md`. When in doubt, default to per-project: promoting
later is cheaper than demoting.
